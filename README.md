# Project Name: 3D Visualization and Design

## Description
This repository contains all relevant files for my 3D Scene project, completed as part of my coursework in computational graphics and visualization. This project showcases my ability to create a fully realized 3D world, emphasizing my understanding of the development process from conception through realization.

### Contents
- **3D Scene ZIP Folder**: Includes all the necessary files to load and view the 3D scene I developed.
- **Design Decisions Document**: A detailed explanation of the design choices made during the project.
- **README.md**: This document, providing an overview and reflection on the project.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   https://github.com/vhicktour/SNHU-CS330.git
   ```
2. **Unzip the 3D Scene Folder**:
   - Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo and unzip the 3D Scene ZIP folder.

3. **Software Requirements**:
   - Ensure you have the required 3D rendering software installed, as specified in the 3D Scene folder's documentation.

## Running the Project

1. Open the 3D rendering software.
2. Import the project files from the unzipped 3D Scene folder.
3. Follow the instructions within the software to render the scene.

## Project Reflections
### Approach to Designing and Developing Software
I approach software design with a focus on user experience and functionality, ensuring that the design serves the intended purpose effectively. In developing programs, I start with a robust planning phase, followed by iterative coding and testing.

### Learning and Skills Enhancement
Through this project, I've honed my skills in 3D modeling and improved my understanding of computational graphics. New design skills acquired include advanced texturing and lighting techniques, while on the development side, I've become adept at using scripting within the rendering software to automate tasks.

### Design and Development Process
The project followed a structured design process starting with concept sketches and moving through detailed 3D modeling. Development was iterative, with continuous integration of feedback and testing results leading to successive refinements.

### Future Applications
The skills and techniques developed during this project are directly applicable to future work in game development, virtual reality environments, and simulation applications. The iterative design and development approach can be adapted to various other tech projects, ensuring flexibility and robustness in my work.
